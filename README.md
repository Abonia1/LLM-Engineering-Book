### 3: Fine-Tuning, Adaptation, Evaluation, and Debugging of LLMs

This chapter explains the essential techniques for fine-tuning, adapting, evaluating, and debugging LLMs, enhancing model performance for specific tasks. Key topics include:
- **Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Task-specific heads, RLHF-based tuning, and prompt-based learning.
- **Domain Adaptation**: Methods for transferring knowledge and continuous learning.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and human evaluations.
- **Debugging Techniques**: Visualizing attention, gradient analysis, and ablation studies.
- **Ethics and Current Research Trends**.

### 4: Real-World Applications of RAG and LLMs

Chapter 4 presents case studies and examples of LLM and RAG applications across diverse industries, showcasing their versatility and value. Covered topics include:
- **Industry Case Studies**: Examples in conversational AI, biomedical analysis, and legal search.
- **Problem-Solving with RAG**: Open-domain QA, multi-step reasoning, and long-form text generation.
